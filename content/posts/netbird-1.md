# Implementing Zero Trust Security at Home—Part 1: Introduction to Zero Trust Networking and NetBird

In recent years, many technology enthusiasts, privacy advocates, and everyday home users have turned towards **self-hosting** their online services—such as email, photo storage, file-sharing, and even media streaming. Hosting your own services at home gives you more privacy and total control over your data—advantages that cloud solutions often can't match.

However, hosting your own services comes with security challenges and privacy risks. Most home internet connections aren't designed initially for secure remote access, so many people default to methods such as exposing ports directly or using outdated VPN setups. These approaches can unintentionally open doors for attackers, placing your personal data potentially at risk.

Does that mean you should give up self-hosting? Absolutely not.

There's a better way—a modern security practice called **Zero Trust Networking**. In this series, I'll introduce you to an open-source tool I've started using at home called **NetBird**, and I'll guide you step-by-step through enhancing the safety of your home network and hosted services.

## Why Traditional Home Networks Aren't Secure Enough  
Typically, people hosting their own services at home use one of these methods for remote access:

- Exposing services using router-based port-forwarding.
- Setting up simple, traditional VPNs.

Both methods can leave your home network vulnerable. Openly exposed ports increase the risk of being targeted by attackers via automated scans or exploits. Traditional VPN setups, while better than exposed ports, sometimes have outdated security protocols, overly broad access (i.e., once someone connects, they can access too much), or tedious configuration hurdles that discourage regular updates and audits.

## The Zero Trust Networking Philosophy
"Never Trust, Always Verify" is the cornerstone of Zero Trust Networking. Instead of automatically trusting devices and users once they enter a network (like traditional VPNs), Zero Trust Networking ensures continuous rigorous authentication and authorization for every single connection.

Zero Trust Networking operates on key principles:

- **Continuous authentication:** Every access attempt is regularly authenticated, regardless of being "inside" or "outside" the network.
- **Least-privilege principle:** Users and devices receive the absolute minimum level of access they need to function—no more risk of overly broad access.
- **Contextual access control:** Policies are applied based on identity, device risk, location, and time, ensuring access to sensitive services is controlled carefully.

## Meet NetBird—Easy, Secure, Zero Trust Networking at Home
My tool of choice for bringing Zero Trust Networking into the home environment is an open-source project named [**NetBird**](https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird).

NetBird combines the security advantages of the **WireGuard** VPN protocol with a user-friendly experience, making it simple to securely manage a home-based network. Here's why NetBird stands out:

- **WireGuard-based:** Offers modern VPN features including strong encryption, high performance, and low overhead.
- **Simple NAT traversal:** Devices remain reachable even behind home routers with minimal configuration.
- **Centralized policy management:** Easily enforce security policies like who can access particular services and under what conditions.
- **Peer-to-peer:** Devices connect directly when possible, reducing latency and improving reliability.
- **Open-source & transparent:** NetBird is publicly auditable, trusted, freely available, and actively maintained.
